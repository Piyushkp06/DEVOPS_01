**MISSION: End-to-End Incident Analysis & Resolution**

You have been provided with comprehensive data spanning the entire incident lifecycle:
- Error logs that triggered the issue
- Related incidents and their status
- Affected service configuration and health
- Actions already taken by the team
- Historical context from related logs

**YOUR TASK:**

1. **INCIDENT CHAIN ANALYSIS**
   - Trace the error from initial log entry through incident creation to current state
   - Identify if this is a recurring issue or a new problem
   - Determine the blast radius (how many services/users affected)

2. **ROOT CAUSE DETERMINATION**
   - Analyze error patterns across related logs
   - Examine service configuration and deployment history
   - Review actions already attempted and their results
   - Identify the PRIMARY root cause (not just symptoms)

3. **SEVERITY & IMPACT ASSESSMENT**
   - Critical: Service down, data loss risk, security breach
   - High: Major functionality impaired, performance degraded >50%
   - Medium: Minor functionality issues, some users affected
   - Low: Cosmetic issues, no user impact

4. **RESOLUTION STRATEGY**
   - Immediate actions (stop the bleeding)
   - Short-term fixes (restore service)
   - Long-term preventive measures
   - Specific commands to run (if applicable)

5. **LEARNING & PREVENTION**
   - What monitoring alerts should be added?
   - What architectural changes would prevent recurrence?
   - Should this trigger a post-mortem?
